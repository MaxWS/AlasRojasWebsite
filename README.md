Project brief

Title: "Red Wings" Soccer Club Team Website

Introduction: This Project is the official website for the Red Wings Soccer Club, located in Montevideo, Uruguay. I designed and developed the entire project myself. This was my Final Project during the course I did at General Assembly (Front-End Web Development). This Project is very personal because I played for this team when I was a kid and currently the management are very close friends of mine. It was my gift for all the good memories I have from my childhood.
The website has information related to the history of the club and general information about operations. It has useful information about the different ways to get involved and ways to help the club. I incorporated 'Google API' within the website to easily have access to the field location. 
The entire website UI was done using 'Grid-CSS', 'CSS Flex-box', 'Google Fonts' and 'Font Awesome'. As a bonus I did a whole re-design of the logo and branding with the help of a professional Graphic Designer.  

Technologies: 
* Grid-CSS
